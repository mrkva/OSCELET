#OSCELET

Processing + Kinect -> OSC skeleton

with example use in MaxMSP and Supercollider

Requirements:

* osc5
* simple-open-ni

Program is set up to send to 57120 (default Supercollider port). So far it's just torso, but rest can be added easily.

The whole processing part is built on top of Max Rheiner example for simple open ni library.

Enjoy!
